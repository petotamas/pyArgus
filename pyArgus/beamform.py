     Description:
     ------------
        The beamform module of the PyArgus library implements antenna array processing methods which are intended to
        calculate weight coefficients for beamformers. These techniques can operate either in a fixed or in an adaptive
        manner.
        The following functions implement fixed beamforming strategies:
            - fixed_max_sir_beamform()
            - Godara_max_sir_beamform()

        The implemented adaptive beamformers are the following:
            - Minimum Variance Distortionless Response (MVDR)

        Description:
        ------------

            The fixed maximum signal to interference (MaxSIR) beamformer calculates the weight coefficient in a way to
            ensure that the resulting radiation pattern satisfies the preliminary specified requirements. The calculated
            beampattern will have the required responses in the specified directions.

        Two different implementation exist for this function call. One of them use a for loop to iterate through the
        signal samples while the other  use a direct vector product from numpy. The latter consumes more memory
        but much faster for large arrays. The implementation can be selected using the "imp" function parameter.
        Set imp="mem_eff" to use the memory efficient implementation with a for loop or set to "fast" in order to use
        the faster direct matrix product implementation.
