# pyArgus

This python package aims to implement signal processing algorithms applicabe in antenna arrays. The implementation mainly focuses on the beamforming and
direction finiding algorithms.
For array synthesis and radiation pattern optimization please check the "arraytool" python package.

Named after Argus the giant from the greek mitology who had hundreds of eyes.

##The package is organized as follows:

-pyArgus: Main package directory
--antennaArrayPattern: Implements the radiation pattern calculation of antenna arrays

-docs: Contains Ipython notebook files with demonstrations.

-test: Contains demonstration functions.
--patternPlotTest: Radiation pattern plot demonstration function for ULA and UCA antenna arrays.
